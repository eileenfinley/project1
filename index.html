                <h2>What is Ultimate Frisbee?</h2>
                <p> 
                    Ultimate Frisbee, often referred to simply as "Ultimate," is a fast-paced and exhilarating team sport played with a flying disc, commonly known as a Frisbee or disc. The game combines elements of soccer, basketball, 
                    and football, emphasizing continuous movement, teamwork, and fair play. Two teams of 7 players each compete on a rectangular field with end zones at either end. The objective is to pass the disc among teammates, 
                    working collaboratively to advance it toward the opposing team's end zone and score points by catching it there. Unique to Ultimate is the emphasis on a "Spirit of the Game" ethos, promoting sportsmanship, respect, 
                    and self-officiation, where players are responsible for their own conduct on the field. The inclusive and spirited nature of Ultimate Frisbee has contributed to its popularity worldwide as a dynamic and engaging sport for players of all skill levels.

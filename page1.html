                    <p>
                        Ultimate Frisbee, a non-contact team sport played with a flying disc, originated in the 1960s. 
                        Students in American high schools, including Columbia High School in New Jersey, developed a game that combined aspects of football, soccer, and basketball, using a Frisbee as the primary object. 
                        With an emphasis on sportsmanship and self-officiation, the game quickly gained popularity, and the first rulebook was published in 1970 by the Ultimate Players Association (UPA), which later became USA Ultimate. 
                        Over the years, Ultimate Frisbee evolved, with international recognition and the establishment of gender-inclusive divisions. 
                        It's known not only for its competitive nature but also for its strong sense of community and the "Spirit of the Game" principle, emphasizing fair play and mutual respect.

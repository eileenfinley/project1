                <h2>The Basic Rules</h2>
                <p>
                    Ultimate Frisbee is played between two teams, each aiming to score points by catching the Frisbee in the opposing team's end zone. 
                    The game is non-contact, and here are the basic rules:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Starting Play: The game begins with a "pull," where one team throws the Frisbee to the other, initiating play.</li>
                    <li>Movement: Players can't run while holding the Frisbee but may pivot on one foot to change direction. The defending team marks the thrower.</li>
                    <li>Scoring: Points are scored by catching the Frisbee in the opposing team's end zone, similar to a touchdown in football.</li>
                    <li>Turnovers: If the Frisbee is dropped, intercepted, or goes out of bounds, possession transfers to the other team.</li>
                    <li>Fouls: Players must avoid physical contact, and fouls can be contested or resolved by those involved.</li>
                    <li>Stall Count: The thrower has a limited time (usually ten seconds) to make a pass. If they don't, it's a turnover.</li>
                    <li>Self-Officiation: Players are responsible for their own actions on the field and resolve disputes amicably, promoting the "Spirit of the Game."</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>The Basic Terms of Ultimate</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Backhand: A type of throw which is usually lead by the back of your hand.  This is the most common throw that the general public know. Typically this throw is released on the side opposite your dominant hand.</li>
                    <li>Flick: Also known as a “flick,” the forehand is a type of throw where the disc releases off the first two fingers and is lead by the forehand.  Typically this throw is released from the same side as your dominant hand.</li>
                    <li>Bid/layout: Taking a dive for the disc (whether offensive or defensive).  Someone might say “nice bid!” or “LAYOUT!”</li>
                    <li>Chilly: Do not rush to throw the disc! You likely have teammates running to help you and do not need to throw immediately. You have 10 whole seconds! Wait a second and “chill” out. </li>
                    <li>Cutter: A player whose role is to make cuts for the disc, catch it and get it back to the handler. There are typically more than one cutter on the field. </li>
                    <li>Handler: A player who is assigned the role to move the disc up the field and has the ability to throw the disc exactly where they want it to go.  Kind of like a quarterback in football, except that there are usually multiple handlers on the field at one time.</li>
                    <li>Mark: The defensive player within three meters of the thrower’s pivot or of the thrower if no pivot has been established. If the disc is not in play, a defensive player within three meters of a spot on the field where the disc is to be put into play is considered the mark.</li>
                    <li>Pivot: The particular part of the body in continuous contact with a single spot on the field during a thrower’s possession once the thrower has come to a stop or has attempted a throw or fake. When there is a definitive spot for putting the disc into play, the part of the body in contact with that spot is the pivot.</li>
                    <li>Spirit: Considered the most important aspect of the game.  Since ultimate is self-officiating all players must play with the “Spirit of the Game” in mind.  Respect, honesty, and having fun are part of the Spirit of the Game. Having good spirit also means knowing the rules of the game well.</li>
                    <li>Up: The disc is in the air! You should yell this any time the disc is flying!</li>

                            They have about 3-4 tournaments per semester and travel all around the country.
                            They compete competitively against many different schools.

                            The Men's Ultimate team is called JuJiTSU! They also practice twice a week.
                            They are very similar to the women's team with having 3-4 tournaments per semester across the country.
                            Both teams are club teams at Truman.

                            Intramural frisbee is only local to Truman's campus. Typically, it is less experienced players.
                            They play a game a week with no practices and play against other teams on campus.
                            Intramural frisbee is much more casaul on campus than club frisbee.

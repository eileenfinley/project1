                            They have about 3-4 tournaments per semester and travel all around the country.

                            They are very similar to the women's team with having 3-4 tournaments per semester across the country.

                            They play a game a week with no practices and play against other teams on campus.
                            Intramural frisbee is much more casaul on campus than club frisbee.
